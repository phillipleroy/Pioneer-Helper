# Privacy Policy for Pioneer Helper

**Last updated:** February 10, 2026

Pioneer Helper (the "App") is designed to help users track ministry records. Your privacy is important to us.

## Data We Collect

Pioneer Helper does **not** collect personal data from you on our servers.

- No account creation
- No analytics or tracking SDKs
- No advertising identifiers
- No location tracking

## Data Stored on Your Device

The App stores your records locally on your device, including:

- Ministry time entries (hours/minutes and dates)
- Monthly Bible study counts
- App preferences (such as theme and pioneer type)

This data is stored only to make app features work.

## Backup and Import

If you use the backup feature, the App creates a JSON backup file that you choose where to save (for example, Files or iCloud Drive). If you use import, the App reads the file you selected.

We do not receive, upload, or process those files on external servers.

## Data Sharing

Pioneer Helper does not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties.

## Children’s Privacy

Pioneer Helper is not directed to children under 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.
